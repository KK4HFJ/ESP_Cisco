# ESP_Cisco
 WiFi Remote Console Interface

Telnet into a ESP with the IP address (displayed on the LCD), and access a connected Cisco switch. Uses a MAX3232 TTL to RS232 converter.

Based on ESPTelnet library at https://github.com/LennartHennigs/ESPTelnet/

Still needs some work, as the Cisco prompts are doubled. Is completely functional.
